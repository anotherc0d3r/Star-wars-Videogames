### Star-Wars-Videogames

## About My Website
My Project is a review Website about Star Wars Videogames. It aims to give a fresh perspective on the games and how they play.
I chose this because I am interested in Star Wars, The different ways they make videogames and the change over years.

## The Design
- Colour
- The colours chosen were based on the Star Wars theme.

## Layout

1. I used the same layout for every page (same CSS) because it then seems like you stay on the same website as you change pages.
2. I remade every page in Maori to make it multilingual.
3. I used CSS Grid to organise my website page easily.

## Fonts 

I used Times New Roman, Times and Serif for my fonts because they are easy to read and basic.
